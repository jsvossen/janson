#Just Another Social Network

Deployed at [https://janson-91841.herokuapp.com/](https://janson-91841.herokuapp.com/)

This is a simple social network site featuring the core functionality of Facebook, including posts, friends, likes, and comments. Users also recieve notifications for friend requests as well as when someone likes or comments on their post.

Create your own account or log in as the test user to try it out (email: test@test.com, password: test).

This was built as the final project for The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum. Find it at [http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project).
